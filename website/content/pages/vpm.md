# VPM

To Variational Prosody Model (VPM) is able to capture a part of the prosodic prototype variance. Its variational CGs (VCGs) use the linguistic context input to map out a prosodic latent space for each contour. This two-dimensional latent space can then be used to visualise the captured context-specific variation. Since the VCGs are still based on synthesising the contours based on rhythmic unit position input, the mapped prosodic latent space is amenable for exploration only for short contours, such as Chinese tones or clitics.
