# WSFC

The Weighted SFC (WSFC) model is an extension to the SFC that can capture the prominence of each functional prototype contour in the final prosody. It does so through incorporating weighted contour generators (WCGs) in which weights are used to scale the prosodic contours based on their linguistic context. The WSFC has been shown to be able to successfully capture the impact of attitude and emphasis on prototype prominence.
